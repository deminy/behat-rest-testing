Summary
=======

This repo is to help developers to easily understand how to do feature tests with Behat, and to start writing
feature tests for REST APIs.

This is based on [Keith Loy's work](https://github.com/kloy/behat-rest-testing) (which was essential a hard fork of 
[Chris Cornutt's work](https://github.com/enygma/behat-fuel-rest)), with following major changes made by me:

* The best of all: for the project you are working on, you don't have to put this repo into your project or create
feature tests under this repo. You can always create feature tests under your project, then use this repo to run
the tests. Thus, both your project and this repo are separated from each other and clean.
* Added sample RESTful services, and changed/added features to test against the services.
* Added samples for closured steps.
* Added samples for closured hooks.
* Removed anything related to PHP framework [Laravel](http://laravel.com/).

Because of the heavy changes made above, instead of forking from Keith's repo directly, I created a new repo with same
repo name.

# Dependencies

* [PHP](http://www.php.net) 5.3.0+
* PHP extension [mbstring](http://www.php.net/mbstring) (used by [Behat](http://www.behat.org))

# Install

You will need to download composer.phar and run the install command under the same directory where the 'composer.json'
file is located:

```
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php && ./composer.phar install
```

# How to Test

### 1. Set up and run REST API server.

You can have a virtual host set up under Apache, with DocumentRoot set to "www/" of this repo and DirectoryIndex set
to "router.php". Alternatively, you may consider to use the 
[PHP 5.4 built-in web server](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php):

#### 1.1. Install PHP 5.4.

If you happen not have PHP 5.4, please download it and use following command to install it:

```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php54
make
sudo make install
```

#### 1.2. Start the REST API server.

To start the [PHP 5.4 built-in web server](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php), please
run following command:

```
/usr/local/php54/bin/php -S localhost:8081 www/router.php
```

The web server now serves as the REST API server. You can visit URL http://localhost:8081 to see if the server runs
properly or not (If everything is good, the URL should return string "OK" back).

### 2. Test the sample features.

#### 2.1. Create the configuration file "behat.yml".

For the sample test provided, you can create the file by copying directly from file "behat.yml.dist" without any
modifications required.

#### 2.2. Run the test command.

Now, run following command to test sample features:

```
bin/behat
```

If everything is good, you should see the out as in following screenshot:

# Create Feature Tests for Your Project

You can always create step/hook definitions under the installation of this repo. However, a better way might be to
organize your files like this:

<pre>
/behat-rest-testing/
     behat.yml
/myProject
    src/
    tests/
        features/
        	myProjectFeature.1.feature
        	myProjectFeature.2.feature
            steps/
                myProjectSteps.1.php
                myProjectSteps.2.php
                // ......
            support/
                myProjectHooks.1.php    
                myProjectHooks.2.php
                // ......
</pre>

Your put your step/hook definitions under folder "/myProject/tests/features", and have paths defined in the
configuration file "/behat-rest-testing/behat.yml". Then, you can call command "/behat-rest-testing/bin/behat" to test
your REST APIs.

# TODOs

* Allow to add project-related .feature files outside the repo.
* Support different environments (development, QA, staging, production, etc).

# Known Limitations

* Not allow to add project-related .feature files outside the repo.
* The code may not work under Windows platforms.
